<p> Hello and welcome to my page! My name is Mackenzie Rayfield. </p>

<img src="./images/main.jpg">

<p> Art has been a passion of mine since I was young. When I was 10, my best friend and I started painting together. Soon after that, I discovered a love and a niche for landscape painting. </p>
<p> Painting is where I find peace and connect with God and nature. You'll notice most of my work is inspired by the outdoors, because I love capturing the beauty of the world around us. My hope is that when you view my artwork, you're able to pause, <i>slow down</i>, and notice the beauty of God's creation. </p>
<p> Psalm 19:1 - "The heavens proclaim the glory of God. The skies display his craftsmanship." </p>
<p> If there's a "moment" in your world you'd like me to capture, I'd love to hear from you. </p>
